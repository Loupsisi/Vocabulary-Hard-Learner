This is a WebAPP I created.
It lets you create lists of words with their translation or whatever you want.
You can then choose/see any of your lists of words to write their translation in the input box.
You can swap the mode of guess between like Translation-Word --> Word-Translation.

Press "Escape" if you want to skip quicker. 
Press "Enter" when you typed the name of your list to create it.
